**Currently looking for a job in a Data Science/Analysis position.**

I am a graduate research assistant in the [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/) at University of Toronto, currently working with professor [Monica Alexander](https://www.monicaalexander.com/). I received my MSc in Statistics from the same university. I'm interested in applied statistics and deep learning for time series and text analysis.

On my free time I'm interested in Formula 1, tennis and table tennis.
