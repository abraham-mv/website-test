<p>Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations are very important in physics. The solutions for HPDE are wave-like, and that use case is the one that we’ll be exploring in this post. However they are also used in fluid mechanics, most of the adavances in numerical solutions come from this field.</p>

<p>The wave equation can be deducted using Hooke’s law.</p>

<p>The force which the middle mass is experiencing can be expressed using Newton’s law as follows.
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?F_{newton}=ma(t)=m\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}u(x+h,t)" title="Newton's Law" height="55" class="center" /></p>

<p>It can also be expressed as using Hooke’s law:</p>

<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?F_{Hooke}=F_{x+2h}-F_x=k[u(x+2h,t)-u(x+h,t)]-k[u(x+h,t)-u(x,t)]." title="Hooke's Law" height="25" class="center" /></p>

<p>Now we equal both equations:</p>

<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?m\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}u(x+h,t)=k[u(x+2h,t)-u(x+h,t)]-k[u(x+h,t)-u(x,t)]." title="Hooke's Law" height="55" class="center" /></p>

<p>Now we assume that we have N equal mases uniformally distributed along a horizontal line of length L, united by springs with constants k. With a total mass of M = Nm and a total spring constant of K = k/N. If h is the separation between each mass:</p>

<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}u(x+h,t)=\frac{KL^2}{M}\frac{u(x+2h,t)-2u(x+h,t)+u(x,t)}{h^2}." title="PDE" height="55" class="center" /></p>

<p>If we take the limit:</p>

<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}u(x+h,t)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{KL^2}{M}\frac{u(x+2h,t)-2u(x+h,t)+u(x,t)}{h^2}" title="PDE" height="55" class="center" /></p>

<p>we see that this is just the second partial derivative with respect to x:</p>

<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{\partial^2u(x,t)}{\partial t^2}=\frac{KL^2}{M}\frac{\partial^2u(x,t)}{\partial x^2}." title="PDE" height="55" class="center" /></p>

<p>We can see that the constant in this equation is the square of the propagation speed. If the value of u and it’s first derivative with respect to t are especified for t=0 there’s a solution for at any time t, which should describe the movement of a wave. It is easy to see, as well that for 2 dimensions the equations is:</p>

<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial t^2}=\alpha\left[\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial y^2}\right]." title="PDE" height="55" class="center" /></p>

<p>We used this deduction because the program assumes that we’ll have N mases attached to each other by springs.</p>
