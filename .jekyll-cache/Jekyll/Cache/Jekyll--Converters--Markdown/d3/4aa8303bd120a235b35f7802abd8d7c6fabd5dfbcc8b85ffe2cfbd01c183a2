<p>Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations are very important in physics. The solutions for HPDE are wave-like, and that use case is the one that weâ€™ll be exploring in this post. However they are also used in fluid mechanics, most of the adavances in numerical solutions come from this field.</p>

<p>The wave equation can be deducted using Hookeâ€™s law.</p>

<p>The force which the middle mass is experiencing can be expressed using Newtonâ€™s law as follows.
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?F_{newton}=ma(t)=m\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}u(x+h,t)" title="Newton's Law" height="55" class="center" /></p>

<p>It can also be expressed as using Hookeâ€™s law:</p>

<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?F_{Hooke}=F_{x+2h}-F_x=k[u(x+2h,t)-u(x+h,t)]-k[u(x+h,t)-u(x,t)]." title="Hooke's Law" height="25" class="center" /></p>

<p>Now we equal both equations:</p>

<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?m\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}u(x+h,t)=k[u(x+2h,t)-u(x+h,t)]-k[u(x+h,t)-u(x,t)]." title="Hooke's Law" height="55" class="center" /></p>

<p>Now we assume that we have N equal mases uniformally distributed along a horizontal line of length L, united by springs with constants k. With a total mass of M = Nm and a total spring constant of K = k/N. If h is the separation between each mass:</p>

<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}u(x+h,t)=\frac{KL^2}{M}\frac{u(x+2h,t)-2u(x+h,t)+u(x,t)}{h^2}." title="PDE" height="55" class="center" /></p>

<p>We take the limit:</p>

<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}u(x+h,t)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{KL^2}{M}\frac{u(x+2h,t)-2u(x+h,t)+u(x,t)}{h^2}." title="PDE" height="55" class="center" /></p>

<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\frac{\partial^2u(x,t)}{\partial t^2}=\frac{KL^2}{M}\frac{\partial^2u(x,t)}{\partial x^2}." title="PDE" height="55" class="center" /></p>
