<p>Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations are very important in physics. The solutions for HPDE are wave-like, and that use case is the one that weâ€™ll be exploring in this post. However they are also used in fluid mechanics, most of the adavances in numerical solutions come from this field.</p>
