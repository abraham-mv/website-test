<p>Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations are very important in physics. The solutions for HPDE are wave-like, and that use case is the one that we’ll be exploring in this post. However they are also used in fluid mechanics, most of the adavances in numerical solutions come from this field.</p>

<p>The wave equation can be deducted using Hooke’s law.</p>
