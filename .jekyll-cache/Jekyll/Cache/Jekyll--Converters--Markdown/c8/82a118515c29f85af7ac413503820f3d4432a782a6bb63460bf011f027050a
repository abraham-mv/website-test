I"<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
<p>In this post we will build and evaluate two bayesian models to predict the probability of a driver finishing in the top 5 of a given race. The data was scrapped from the FIA‚Äôs website, check out my post LINK HERE, for more information on webscrapping. The raw data was later transformed using another script which you can find in my github repo LINK HERE. Specifically the following modifications were made:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Indy-500 race was dropped since most regular F1 drivers didn‚Äôt participated in it.</li>
  <li>Observations that had two drivers were separated into two rows, with all other variables equal. (If two drivers shared one car in a race and scored points, these were divided equally between them).</li>
  <li>Make sure a driver only appear once in a grand prix, if he had two or more entries the one with the most amount of laps was kept.</li>
  <li>Lap time, total race time, and best lap of the race were all character variables, which were transformed to total seconds.</li>
  <li>Race position contained ‚ÄúDNF‚Äù (Did Not Finish) indicators, which were set to 99, and missing values too.</li>
  <li>The engine variable was transformed to only display the manufacturer, leaving out model number and other additional information.</li>
  <li>Teams and engines were transformed to factor variable, those that didn‚Äôt appear more than 10 times in the whole dataset were set to ‚Äúother‚Äù.</li>
  <li>Teams that only had one distinct driver in the whole dataset were set to ‚Äúsolo‚Äù.</li>
</ol>
